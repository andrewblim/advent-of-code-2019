# advent-of-code-2019

Clojure-based solutions for [Advent of Code, 2019](https://adventofcode.com/). I'm using this as an opportunity to learn how to program in Clojure and how to use Spacemacs (coming from a background of neither emacs nor vim). 

The code for each day can be found under the namespace `advent-of-code-2019.dayXX`. Input files are stored under `resources/inputs/dayXX.txt`. Tests based on sample inputs, typically provided in the problem texts themselves, can be found under the namespace `advent-of-code-2019.dayXX-test`.
